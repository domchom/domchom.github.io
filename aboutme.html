            <h4><b>About</b></h4>
            <p>Hi, I'm Dominic Chomchai, a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
                studying cytokinesis in the lab of Bill Bement.</p>
            <br>
            <p> See the various projects I am working on in the menu bar to the left. You can 
                also view the trips I went on since I started dabbling in photography. These are
                less curated, but felt like I wanted to have a space for them anyway.

            <h4><b>Random Notes on Photos</b></h4>
            <p>​​​​​​​For digital images, anything before January 2025 was likely taken with the Ricoh GR III, and 
                anything after with the Fujifilm X100VI. Most of my recent digital images are SOOC or have minimal 
                edits since I usually prefer minimal effort when shooting digital.<br><br>
                For 35mm film, most of my shots are taken with a Canon A-1 and a Canon 50mm f/1.8 FD Mount lens. 
                For 120 film, I have uses the Fujica GW690 - which has a fixed 90mm f/3.5 lens - and the Mamiya 
                RB67 Pro-S. I meter my 120 film shots using Ansel Adams’ zone system and a Minolta Spotmeter F. <br><br>
                For film, I develop color negatives at home using the Cinestill C-41 kit and black-and-white film 
                with Ilford Ilfosol 3. <br><br>
                I scan 35mm film either with a Plustek OpticFilm 7600i scanner or using a DIY copy-stand setup. 
                For the copy stand, I use the Cinestill CS-Lite as a light source, a Canon EOS Rebel SL1, and 
                a vintage Vivitar Macro 55mm f/2.8 1:1 lens. <br><br>
                120 film is scanned using the same copy-stand setup, but since the negatives are larger, I take
                 multiple shots of different parts of the frame and stitch them together in Photoshop or Lightroom Classic.
                Negative scans are converted with the Negative Lab Pro Lightroom plugin, and I make minor adjustments 
                to white balance, exposure, sharpening, contrat, dust removal, and any other small tweaks that feel necessary.​​​​​​​ <br><br>

            <p>If you have somehow found this website and think it looks like and runs like shit, 
                you are not be wrong. I'm using it to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also
                using it to share my photography, which probably also looks like shit. I don't
                have any excuse for that.</p>
