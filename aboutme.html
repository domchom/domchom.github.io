            <h4><b>About</b></h4>
            <p>Hi, I'm Dominic Chomchai, a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
                studying cytokinesis in the lab of Bill Bement.</p>
            <br>
            <p> See the various projects I am working on in the menu bar to the left. You can 
                also view the trips I went on since I started dabbling in photography. These are
                less curated, but felt like I wanted to have a space for them anyway. 
            </p>

            <p>If you have somehow found this website and think it looks like and runs like shit, 
                you are not be wrong. I'm using it to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also
                using it to share my photography, which probably also looks like shit. I don't
                have any excuse for that.</p>
